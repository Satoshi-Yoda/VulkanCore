Qualities:
 + batch drawing + v0.1
 - color selection
 - text & rubber kerning
 - rare updates
 - workers & multithreading
 - replays

Several drawables:
 - Organize cave batch into single folder, rework glsl files compilation
 - Duplicate Cave into Rectangle
 - Duplicate CaveLayout into RectangleLayout
 - Duplicate cave shaders to rectangle shaders
 - Declare some rectangles in lava
 - Draw some rectangles in tectonic
 - Modify Rectangle to be just rectangle
 - See what is common between Cave and Rectangle

Path:
 ? Look at cpu ram vertex buffer at vulkan tutorial, without staging buffer for dynamic & stream mode
 ? maybe use vkCmdUpdateBuffer() for small data buffers

Omitted:
 - indexed drawing
 - z-buffering
 - msaa
 - mipmapping

Features:
 - sprite lifecycle
 + instanced drawing

Optimizations:
 - create lazy hash? map for descriptorSets with keys: uniformBuffer + currentTextureView + currentTextureSampler instead of updating them every frame
