Qualities:
 + batch drawing + v0.1
 - color selection
 - text & rubber kerning
 - rare updates
 - workers & multithreading
 - replays

Path:
 ? Look at cpu ram vertex buffer at vulkan tutorial, without staging buffer for dynamic & stream mode
 ? maybe use vkCmdUpdateBuffer() for small data buffers

Omitted:
 - indexed drawing
 - z-buffering
 - msaa
 - mipmapping

Features:
 - sprite lifecycle
 + instanced drawing

Optimizations:
 - create lazy hash? map for descriptorSets with keys: uniformBuffer + currentTextureView + currentTextureSampler instead of updating them every frame
