Things happens with one texture:
	Lava.establishVertexBuffer():
		vertexBuffer, vertexBufferSize used in Tectonic::prepareFrame()
		vertexBufferMemory stored privately in lava
	Lava.establishTexture():
		textureImage used in Tectonic::createDescriptorSets()
		textureImageView used in Tectonic::createDescriptorSets()
		textureImageMemory stored privately in lava
	Tectonic::createDescriptorSets():
		descriptorSets[IN_FLIGHT_FRAMES] used in Tectonic::prepareFrame()
		? Do I need to keep IN_FLIGHT_FRAMES descriptor sets instead of single one ? -> because it is linked to uniformBuffers[i]
