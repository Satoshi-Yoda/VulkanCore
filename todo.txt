Qualities:
 - canvases
 + batch drawing + v0.1
 + team & multithreading + v0.1
 - color selection
 - text & rubber kerning
 - slicer
 - rare updates
 - replays

Wishes:
 - put (ash, team, batcher, mountain, rocks, crater, lava, tectonic) inside engine somehow?
 - RectangleLayout & GraphicLayout are almost the same, maybe separate common part somehow?

Path:
 + Organize cave batch into single folder, rework glsl files compilation
 + Duplicate Cave into Rectangle
 + Duplicate CaveLayout into RectangleLayout
 + Duplicate cave shaders to rectangle shaders
 + Declare some rectangles in lava
 + Draw some rectangles in tectonic
 - Modify Rectangle to be just rectangle
 - See what is common between Cave and Rectangle

Omitted:
 - indexed drawing
 - z-buffering
 - msaa
 - mipmapping

Optimizations:
 ? Look at cpu ram vertex buffer at vulkan tutorial, without staging buffer for dynamic & stream mode
 ? maybe use vkCmdUpdateBuffer() for small data buffers
