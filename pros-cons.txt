Pros:
	- Modern C++ syntax
	- Better performance [test it]
	- Loading in separate threads (queue family) [test it]
	- Drawing in separate threads [test it]
	- Compute shaders, compute families [learn it]
	- No problems with win high dpi
	- 10 bit support [test it]
	- Separated image samplers from images
	- Good control over swap chain frames count
	- Wide variety of presentation modes (vsync)
	- Latest GLSL version support
	- Ability to sample textures in pixel coordinates instead of normalized coordinates

Cons:
	- Verbose API
	- No support of old GPUs (9+ years)
	- Static GLSL shaders (leads to some complications)
