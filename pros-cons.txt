Pros:
	- Better performance [test it]
	- Loading in separate threads (queue family) [test it]
	- Drawing in separate threads [test it]
	- Compute shaders, compute families [learn it]
	- No problems with win high dpi
	- 10 bit support [test it]
	- Separated image samplers from images
	- Good control over swap chain frames count
	- Wide variety of presentation modes (vsync)
	- Latest GLSL version support
	- Ability to sample textures in pixel coordinates instead of normalized coordinates
	- You can define but not use shader outer variables

Cons:
	- Verbose API
	- No support of old GPUs (2012+ for NVidia, 2017+ for Intel, ? AMD)
	- Static GLSL shaders (leads to some complications)
	- Immutable pipelines
	- Troubles with windowed vsync [test it in opengl]
